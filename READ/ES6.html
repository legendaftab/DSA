    ES6 (ECMAScript 6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language
    specification. It was released in June 2015 and brought significant changes and improvements to the language,
    including new syntax features and methods.
    ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification created by Ecma International, a European standards
    organization. The purpose of the ECMAScript specification is to standardize the syntax, semantics, and behavior of
    scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.
    JavaScript is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript, and it's used to build web applications, server-side
    applications, and mobile applications. ECMAScript 6 introduced a lot of new features to JavaScript, including:
    1. Arrow functions
    2. Classes
    3. Template literals
    4. Destructuring
    5. Default parameters
    6. Rest and spread operators
    7. Promises
    8. Symbols
    9. Generators
    10. Modules
    These features and many more have made JavaScript more powerful, expressive, and easier to work with. Many of these
    new features have been supported by modern web browsers, and they are becoming more widely adopted by developers.
    In summary, ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification, and ES6 is the sixth major release of the
    ECMAScript specification, which introduced many new features to JavaScript. These features have made JavaScript a
    more powerful and expressive language, and they are widely used in modern web development.
