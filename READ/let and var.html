    In JavaScript, the let and const keywords are used to declare variables. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
    as alternatives to the var keyword. The let keyword declares a block-scoped variable, while the const keyword
    declares a read-only, block-scoped variable.
    The let keyword
    The Let keyword is used to declare a variable that is block-scoped. This means that the variable is only accessible
    within the block in which it is declared, including any nested blocks. A block is defined by a set of curly braces
    {}. Here's an example:
    function example() {
    let x = 1;
    if (true) {
    let x = 2;
    console.log(x); // 2
    }
    console.log(x); // 1
    }
    In this example, the variable x is declared twice using the let keyword. The first declaration creates a variable in
    the example() function's scope and initializes it with the value 1. The second declaration creates a new variable in
    the if statement's scope and initializes it with the value 2. When we log x inside the if block, we get 2. When we
    log x outside the if block, we get 1. This is because the two x variables are in different scopes.


    The const keyword
    The const keyword is used to declare a read-only, block-scoped variable. This means that the variable cannot be
    reassigned a new value after it has been initialized. Here's an example: function example() {
    const x = 1;
    if (true) {
    const x = 2;
    console.log(x); // 2
    }
    console.log(x); // 1 }
    In this example, the variable x is declared twice using the const keyword. The first declaration creates a variable
    in the example() function's scope and initializes it with the value 1. The second declaration creates a new variable
    in the if statement's scope and initializes it with the value 2. When we log x inside the if block, we get 2. When
    we log x outside the if block, we get 1. This is because the two x variables are in different scopes, and the const
    keyword prevents the variable from being reassigned a new value. function example() {
    const x = {y: 1 };
    x.y = 2;
    console.log(x.y); // 2
    J
    In this example, we declare a const variable x and initialize it with an object that has a property y with a value
    of 1. We then reassign the value of the y property to 2. This works because the const keyword only prevents
    reassignment of the variable itself, not its properties.


    When to use let and const
    It's generally recommended to use const by default and only use let when you know the value of a variable needs to
    change. This can help prevent bugs caused by accidentally reassigning a variable when you didn't intend to. If you
    need to change the value of a variable, you should ask yourself if it needs to be changed at all. If not, consider
    using a const variable instead. If it does need to be changed, use a let variable.
    In conclusion, the let and const keywords are useful for creating block-scoped variables in JavaScript.
