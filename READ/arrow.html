    Arrow functions are a new way of writing functions in JavaScript introduced in ES6. They offer a more concise syntax
    for creating functions and have some unique properties compared to traditional function declarations. In this
    article, we'll explore arrow functions in detail and provide some examples to help you understand how to use them
    effectively.
    Syntax of Arrow Functions
    The syntax of arrow functions is straightforward. Here's an example:
    const multiply = (a, b) => {
    };
    return a * b;
    The first part of the arrow function is the parameter list (a, b) enclosed in parentheses. The second part is the =>
    symbol, which separates the parameter list from the body of the function. The third part is the body of the function
    enclosed in curly braces {}. In this example, the body of the function returns the product of the two parameters.
    Concise Syntax
    One of the main benefits of arrow functions is their concise syntax. When an arrow function has a single expression
    in the body, you can omit the curly braces {} and the return keyword. Here's an example:
    const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
    In this example, the body of the function is just a single expression a *b. This is equivalent to the previous
    example, but with a more concise syntax.

    No this Binding
    Arrow functions have a unique property in that they don't bind their own this value. Instead, they use the this
    value of the enclosing lexical scope. Here's an example:
    const person = {
    name: "John", age: 30,
    sayName: function() {
    },
    console.log(this.name);
    sayAge: () => {
    console.log(this.age);
    }
    };
    person.sayName(); // "John"
    person.sayAge(); // undefined
    In this example, we define an object person with two methods sayName and sayAge. The sayName method is a traditional
    function declaration and uses the object's this value to log the person's name. The sayAge method is an arrow
    function and tries to log the person's age using the object's this value. However, since arrow functions don't bind
    their own this value, the this value of person.sayAge() is actually the global this value, which is undefined.
